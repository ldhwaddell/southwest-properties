The Regional Plan supports a mix of low and medium-density housing, walkable streets, active transportation routes and quality transit connections in this growth centre through a secondary planning process. A community visioning exercise was completed in 2011 for the Middle Sackville Urban Local Growth Centre. The community identified desired features for the area including recreational opportunities, an outdoor public gathering space, a cultural centre, a commercial centre, a variety of housing types and seniors housing. At their meeting on December 4, 2018, Regional Council directed staff to undertake a comprehensive secondary planning exercise to amend the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, Regional Subdivision By-law, Secondary Municipal Planning Strategies and Land Use By-laws for Sackville and Beaver Bank, Hammonds Plains and Upper Sackville to enable a complete community in the Middle Sackville Urban Local Growth Centre comprised of residential, commercial, institutional and recreational development on lands surrounding the Highway 101 – Margeson Drive interchange.View the staff initiation report.",

This is a residentially zoned site within an established residential area; however the current commercial use is permitted by a development agreement. A development agreement is a legal agreement between the Municipality and a property owner which can allow uses that the zoning does not include, but in turn can also contain site specific requirements to ensure the property is developed in a certain way. Using planning policy which exists in theDartmouth Municipal Planning Strategy, Council previously entered an agreement for this property.

                "proposal": "The applicant is requesting a non-substantive amendment to the existing development agreement (DA) for the Links at Brunello to permit the construction of a nine-storey residential building with 76 dwelling units. The existing development agreement permits a mixed-use development consisting of a golf course, mixed residential uses, park and open space uses, and commercial areas. There have been several amendments to the existing agreement since its approval in 2001. Section 2.4.4 and 3.1(c) of the existing development agreement permits new multi-unit dwellings through a non-substantive amendment to the development agreement. The major aspects of the proposal are as follows: Nine-storey building with parking podium76 dwelling unitsAccessed via Amalfi WaySurface parking for 17 vehicles and internal parking for 80 vehiclesLandscaped yards with screening fence and vegetative buffer The applicant has submitted updated Development Plans (provided below). The updated plans include: Changes to the parking podium and addition of soft landscaping;Reconfiguration of turning circle and pedestrian walkways;Changes to surface parking areas to increase the amount of soft landscaping; andAddition of vegetative buffer and retaining walls. Frequently Asked Questions These FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) have been compiled by HRM staff to answer many of the common questions residents have about the proposal and non-substantive amending agreement process. 1. What is a development agreement?A development agreement is a contract between the landowner and the municipality which says how a piece of land can be used and may include details around land use, building design, the layout of streets and roads, and the density of various land uses. This contract is registered on title and, if the land is sold, all future owners will be responsible for the content of the agreement. Development agreements can be approved by Community Council as long as the proposal meets the rules held within local planning policy documents.2. Why can the developer ask to change an approved development agreement?Changes (or amendments as they are often called) to existing development agreements are fairly common and are often permitted within the development agreement itself. Two categories of changes to an agreement are possible: “Non-Substantive” changes are specifically called out in the original agreement and need to meet the intent of both the policies of the Municipal Planning Strategy as well as the content of the agreement itself. Non-substantive amendments are changes that were contemplated at the time the agreement was originally approved.This proposed amendment is a Non-Substantive Amendment.A Non-Substantive Amendment is a change to the agreement that does not require a formal Public Hearing. The Development Officer may approve non-substantive amendments to a development agreement. This is the case for most requests for non-substantive amendments.A ‘Substantive Amendment” are changes not contemplated by the original agreement, and therefore seen as more significant. These changes still need to meet the intent of the Municipal Planning Strategies and require a Public Hearing to be held before Council makes their decision on the changes.3. How can a multiple unit dwelling be permitted here?The existing development agreement allows multiple unit dwellings in four different areas of this community, as identified on a map previously approved by Council. The site where this building is proposed is within one of the areas that allows multiple unit dwellings. While the use is already allowed, this non-substantive amendment process will specify the look, location, height, density, and other details of the building.4. What’s the role of the planner in the planning application process?The central role of HRM’s planning staff in the planning application process is to compare an application against any Council approved policy and regulation that may apply and make a recommendation to the Development Officer (for non-substantive amendments) or Council for their final decision. As part of this process, HRM staff circulate applications to subject matter experts both within its organization (ie: Development Engineering, Traffic Services, etc.) as well as external to its organization (ie: Nova Scotia Power, Halifax Regional Centre for Education, etc.). Planning staff are available to answer questions and address concerns about the technical details of a project, as well as the planning process itself.5. The view I have from my home will be blocked by this new development. Is that allowed? What about shadows?As a general rule, planning policies do not protect or guarantee private views nor the shadowing of private spaces like backyards, balconies, or solar panels. Some policies do however exist around the protection of public views from key locations such as the Halifax Citadel and the Dartmouth Common. Similarly, there are some policies within newer planning documents that limit the amount of shadow a new building can cast on key public parks such as the Halifax Common.6. Will a vegetative buffer (trees, shrubs, or other landscaping) or privacy screening (fence) be provided?The existing development agreement requires that the parking area be screened by fencing, landscaping, or a combination of both, from the ground floor view of any abutting single unit dwellings. The existing development agreement requires that all areas of the lot not required for parking and access be landscaped, retained in natural vegetation, or a combination of the two. The proposal includes landscaping throughout the site and fencing along all lot boundaries abutting single unit dwellings.7. Can the existing water, wastewater and stormwater service systems capacity handle these additional units?The existing development agreement establishes an overall maximum density for the development agreement area. The proposed amendment will not change nor increase the overall permitted residential density maximums set out in the existing agreement. Water, wastewater & stormwater design specifications and servicing capacity will be confirmed at the permitting stage when detailed drawings and servicing plans are submitted for review.8. Will a crosswalk be provided on Timberlea Village Parkway?This application does not propose new crosswalks or other infrastructure located off the subject site. This would not prevent a reassessment of pedestrian connections and crossings in the area once development is completed.9. What is a traffic impact statement, who prepares them, and how does HRM review them?A traffic impact statement, or TIS, is written at the expense of the applicant by professional engineers. These statements are submitted at the start of the planning application process and give HRM engineers a sense of how a project might impact the surrounding streets both from a safety and capacity perspective. Once submitted, statements are reviewed by HRM engineers to ensure they meet HRM policies, and that the findings in the report are supported by the evidence provided. Any needed changes to the TIS are outlined for the applicant, and this work continues until both sides are in agreement. In this case, no upgrades or changes to the surrounding streets were identified as being required at this time.10. How are construction activities monitored and regulated in the Municipality?Construction activities in the Municipality are administered through several bylaws, which regulate various aspects of the construction process:(i) Blasting By-law B-600: Outlines minimum standards permitted when blasting within the Municipality. All blasting activities require a Blasting Permit from HRM.(ii) Grade Alteration and Stormwater Management Associated With Land Development By-law G-200: Applies to the grade alteration and Stormwater Management of the land.(iii) Construction Management Administrative Order 2018-05-ADM: Outlines best management practices for development of sites in proximity to public streets.(iv) Noise By-Law N-200: States that construction noise activity is permitted between the hours of 7:00am – 8:00 pm on weekdays, 8:00am-7:00pm on Saturdays, and 9:00 am-7:00 pm on Sundays, Statutory Holidays, Civic Holidays and Remembrance Day.(v) Truck Routes By-Law T-400: Controls the routes trucks must use and how trucks access a given site. This by-law applies to trucks used for hauling construction material and commercially uses as well (i.e. moving vans, deliveries, etc.).",

The existing development agreement requires that all areas of the lot not required for parking and access be landscaped, retained in natural vegetation, or a combination of the two. The proposal includes landscaping throughout the site and fencing along all lot boundaries abutting single unit dwellings.7. Can the existing water, wastewater and stormwater service systems capacity handle these additional units?The existing development agreement establishes an overall maximum density for the development agreement area. The proposed amendment will not change nor increase the overall permitted residential density maximums set out in the existing agreement. Water, wastewater & stormwater design specifications and servicing capacity will be confirmed at the permitting stage when detailed drawings and servicing plans are submitted for review.8. Will a crosswalk be provided on Timberlea Village Parkway?This application does not propose new crosswalks or other infrastructure located off the subject site. This would not prevent a reassessment of pedestrian connections and crossings in the area once development is completed.9. What is a traffic impact statement, who prepares them, and how does HRM review them?A traffic impact statement, or TIS, is written at the expense of the applicant by professional engineers. These statements are submitted at the start of the planning application process and give HRM engineers a sense of how a project might impact the surrounding streets both from a safety and capacity perspective. Once submitted, statements are reviewed by HRM engineers to ensure they meet HRM policies, and that the findings in the report are supported by the evidence provided. Any needed changes to the TIS are outlined for the applicant, and this work continues until both sides are in agreement. In this case, no upgrades or changes to the surrounding streets were identified as being required at this time.10. How are construction activities monitored and regulated in the Municipality?Construction activities in the Municipality are administered through several bylaws, which regulate various aspects of the construction process:(i) Blasting By-law B-600: Outlines minimum standards permitted when blasting within the Municipality. All blasting activities require a Blasting Permit from HRM.(ii) Grade Alteration and Stormwater Management Associated With Land Development By-law G-200: Applies to the grade alteration and Stormwater Management of the land.(iii) Construction Management Administrative Order 2018-05-ADM: Outlines best management practices for development of sites in proximity to public streets.(iv) Noise By-Law N-200: States that construction noise activity is permitted between the hours of 7:00am – 8:00 pm on weekdays, 8:00am-7:00pm on Saturdays, and 9:00 am-7:00 pm on Sundays, Statutory Holidays, Civic Holidays and Remembrance Day.(v) Truck Routes By-Law T-400: Controls the routes trucks must use and how trucks access a given site. This by-law applies to trucks used for hauling construction material and commercially uses as well (i.e. moving vans, deliveries, etc.)."

The planning documents have been reviewed and approved by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing as per the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter. This notice was posted to this site onThursday, March 7, 2024, in accordance with the requirements of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ This application has had a long history and was originally considered through a plan amendment process. On August 1, 2017, Regional Council directed staff to consider this application as a site-specific amendment to the now-replaced Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy. Specifically, Regional Council directed staff to continue to process this request for site-specific secondary municipal planning strategy amendments subject to the proposal: (a) generally aligning with theJune 2017 Centre Plandocument relative to Urban Structure, Height and Floor Area Ratio, and (b) addressing the planning principles of transition, pedestrian-orientation, human-scale, building design, and context-sensitive as noted the report. As part of the public engagement strategy for this application,Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committeeand municipal Planning Staff held a public meeting on Monday, June 11, 2018. (Public Meeting Notes) This application was reviewed by theHalifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committeeon August 20, 2018. (Staff Presentation to Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee). The Heritage Advisory Committee(HAC) reviewed this application onWednesday, June 5, 2019. Regional Council hosted a public hearing on July 15, 2019 at Halifax City Hall. Following the hearing, Regional Council passed a motion to adopt the proposed amendments to the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law. The amendments were reviewed by the Provincial Director of Planning and came into effect. The amendments allowed for the consideration of development through the development agreement process. Subsequent to this, the entire policy and land use regulatory context (Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law) affecting Peninsula Halifax were completely replaced with the coming into force of the Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy and the Regional Centre Land Use By-law. The Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy contains policies (IM-42, IM-43, and IM-44) to enable Halifax and West Community Council to consider a development agreement on the subject lands. The new policies IM-42, IM-43, and IM-44 were intended to allow Community Council to consider a development agreement for a proposal submitted in June 2021. However, after further review, staff determined that the enabling policy set was not sufficient in scope to consider all elements of the June 2021 proposal. Therefore, amendments to the enabling policies will first be required before a development agreement for the June 2021 proposal can be considered by Community Council. On September 12, 2023, astaff reportwas before Regional Council for its consideration. Following discussion of the report recommendations, Regional Council initiated a process to consider amending Policies IM-43, IM-44, and IM-46 of the Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy in support of the application. Before any Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy amendments can be approved, Regional Council must first hold a public hearing. Before a development agreement is approved, Halifax and West Community Council must also hold a public hearing. Regional Council and Halifax and West Community Council have the ability to combine both public hearings into one public hearing. As per Section 240A of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, Council is able to provisionally approve a development agreement at the same meeting that it approves amendments to a municipal planning strategy that would be required to enable the consideration of the development agreement. The development agreement provisionally approved is considered fully approved when the supporting amendments to the municipal planning strategy take effect. A copy of any staff report related to this application may be obtained by contacting the office of the Municipal Clerk at 902-490-4210.",

The original development agreement was entered into in 1995 with Annapolis Basin Group Inc. for a 921-unit residential development referred to as Bedford Village, covering approximately 221 acres of land abutting Paper Mill Lake, Hammonds Plains Road and Highway 102. A total of 100 lots were developed in the late 1990s off Moirs Mill Road, Ahmadi Crescent, Richardson Drive and Baha Court. The existing agreement from 1995 stipulates that no more than 100 lots may be developed until such time as the collector road is constructed, because the only route out of the subdivision was eastward to the Bedford Highway and there was a desire to allow for some initial development to take place while also securing an access to Hammonds Plains Road.

The Aerotech Business Park was developed in the 1980s with a plan to create a “campus” supporting aerospace and technology. Planning policies and zones permit industrial uses that support technology- or airport-related facilities only. Since the original plan was made, market demand has changed and there have not been new aerospace-related occupants in some years. Business interest from non-technology and non-aerospace interests, such as warehousing, logistics and distribution, has been consistently active but are not allowed under current zoning rules. A key objective of both the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax's Economic Growth Plan is to ensure there is a sufficient supply of industrial lands to provide economic development opportunities. Aerotech Park is well suited for industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, logistical and transportation uses, given its direct links to 100-series highways and the central location of the international airport. The Park is separated from residential neighbourhoods and there are restrictions around further residential development in the area due to federal noise restriction guidelines surrounding the airport.Council is considering changes to municipal planning policies and zones that would expand the range of permitted industrial uses in Aerotech, and limit retail and commercial operations to accessory uses. No residential uses are being contemplated. Three new zones are being proposed to replace the existing zones: Airport General Industrial (AGI) zone, which will permit both light and heavy industrial uses, and limited commercial and retail that support industrial uses.Airport Commercial Industrial (ACI) zone, which will permit light industrial uses, and a range of supportive commercial, retail and office uses.Halifax International Airport (HIA) Zone, which will permit aircraft, aerospace and airport-related facilities and services, commercial uses that support airport operations, and manufacturing, construction and warehousing uses. The policies and full list of permitted uses proposed for each of these three zones is available here: Airport General IndustrialAirport Commercial IndustrialHalifax International Airport The areas bordering Aerotech Business Park contain wetlands and Provincial protected areas, as well as the Bennery Lake Watershed which supplies servicing to the Halifax International Airport and properties on Aerotech Drive. The Bennery Lake Watershed is designated under Provincial legislation and has Provincial regulations governing activities and land uses in the area. The current municipal designation and zone, applied before these regulations were created, do not reflect the Provincial permitted uses. Amendments are being proposed that would align Provincial and Municipal policies. Council is also considering the following changes to enhance watershed and wilderness protection: Changes to the boundaries of the Protected Area designation and Protected Water Supply zone around Bennery Lake, to reflect the protected area set byProvincial watershed regulations. The watercourse buffers have also been updated to reflect Provincial regulations (within 30 metres of any watercourse and 100 metres of Bennery Lake).Changes to the Regional Plan that would create a new Urban-Settlement-Employment (US-E) zone that would permit utilities, conservation uses, and public parks and playgrounds. The zone would be placed on lands currently zoned Aerotech-Holding (A-H), which border the Waverley Game Sanctuary. Under this zone, the lands would be earmarked for future industrial development, but only after studies establishing environmental, infrastructure, cultural and servicing needs upon development take place.

This is a residentially zoned site within an established residential area; however the current commercial use is permitted by a development agreement. A development agreement is a legal agreement between the Municipality and a property owner which can allow uses that the zoning does not include, but in turn can also contain site specific requirements to ensure the property is developed in a certain way. Using planning policy which exists in theDartmouth Municipal Planning Strategy, Council previously entered an agreement for this property.

                "proposal": "The applicant is requesting a non-substantive amendment to the existing development agreement (DA) for the Links at Brunello to permit the construction of a nine-storey residential building with 76 dwelling units. The existing development agreement permits a mixed-use development consisting of a golf course, mixed residential uses, park and open space uses, and commercial areas. There have been several amendments to the existing agreement since its approval in 2001. Section 2.4.4 and 3.1(c) of the existing development agreement permits new multi-unit dwellings through a non-substantive amendment to the development agreement. The major aspects of the proposal are as follows: Nine-storey building with parking podium76 dwelling unitsAccessed via Amalfi WaySurface parking for 17 vehicles and internal parking for 80 vehiclesLandscaped yards with screening fence and vegetative buffer The applicant has submitted updated Development Plans (provided below). The updated plans include: Changes to the parking podium and addition of soft landscaping;Reconfiguration of turning circle and pedestrian walkways;Changes to surface parking areas to increase the amount of soft landscaping; andAddition of vegetative buffer and retaining walls. Frequently Asked Questions These FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) have been compiled by HRM staff to answer many of the common questions residents have about the proposal and non-substantive amending agreement process. 1. What is a development agreement?A development agreement is a contract between the landowner and the municipality which says how a piece of land can be used and may include details around land use, building design, the layout of streets and roads, and the density of various land uses. This contract is registered on title and, if the land is sold, all future owners will be responsible for the content of the agreement. Development agreements can be approved by Community Council as long as the proposal meets the rules held within local planning policy documents.2. Why can the developer ask to change an approved development agreement?Changes (or amendments as they are often called) to existing development agreements are fairly common and are often permitted within the development agreement itself. Two categories of changes to an agreement are possible: “Non-Substantive” changes are specifically called out in the original agreement and need to meet the intent of both the policies of the Municipal Planning Strategy as well as the content of the agreement itself. Non-substantive amendments are changes that were contemplated at the time the agreement was originally approved.This proposed amendment is a Non-Substantive Amendment.A Non-Substantive Amendment is a change to the agreement that does not require a formal Public Hearing. The Development Officer may approve non-substantive amendments to a development agreement. This is the case for most requests for non-substantive amendments.A ‘Substantive Amendment” are changes not contemplated by the original agreement, and therefore seen as more significant. These changes still need to meet the intent of the Municipal Planning Strategies and require a Public Hearing to be held before Council makes their decision on the changes.3. How can a multiple unit dwelling be permitted here?The existing development agreement allows multiple unit dwellings in four different areas of this community, as identified on a map previously approved by Council. The site where this building is proposed is within one of the areas that allows multiple unit dwellings. While the use is already allowed, this non-substantive amendment process will specify the look, location, height, density, and other details of the building.4. What’s the role of the planner in the planning application process?The central role of HRM’s planning staff in the planning application process is to compare an application against any Council approved policy and regulation that may apply and make a recommendation to the Development Officer (for non-substantive amendments) or Council for their final decision. As part of this process, HRM staff circulate applications to subject matter experts both within its organization (ie: Development Engineering, Traffic Services, etc.) as well as external to its organization (ie: Nova Scotia Power, Halifax Regional Centre for Education, etc.). Planning staff are available to answer questions and address concerns about the technical details of a project, as well as the planning process itself.5. The view I have from my home will be blocked by this new development. Is that allowed? What about shadows?As a general rule, planning policies do not protect or guarantee private views nor the shadowing of private spaces like backyards, balconies, or solar panels. Some policies do however exist around the protection of public views from key locations such as the Halifax Citadel and the Dartmouth Common. Similarly, there are some policies within newer planning documents that limit the amount of shadow a new building can cast on key public parks such as the Halifax Common.6. Will a vegetative buffer (trees, shrubs, or other landscaping) or privacy screening (fence) be provided?The existing development agreement requires that the parking area be screened by fencing, landscaping, or a combination of both, from the ground floor view of any abutting single unit dwellings. The existing development agreement requires that all areas of the lot not required for parking and access be landscaped, retained in natural vegetation, or a combination of the two. The proposal includes landscaping throughout the site and fencing along all lot boundaries abutting single unit dwellings.7. Can the existing water, wastewater and stormwater service systems capacity handle these additional units?The existing development agreement establishes an overall maximum density for the development agreement area. The proposed amendment will not change nor increase the overall permitted residential density maximums set out in the existing agreement. Water, wastewater & stormwater design specifications and servicing capacity will be confirmed at the permitting stage when detailed drawings and servicing plans are submitted for review.8. Will a crosswalk be provided on Timberlea Village Parkway?This application does not propose new crosswalks or other infrastructure located off the subject site. This would not prevent a reassessment of pedestrian connections and crossings in the area once development is completed.9. What is a traffic impact statement, who prepares them, and how does HRM review them?A traffic impact statement, or TIS, is written at the expense of the applicant by professional engineers. These statements are submitted at the start of the planning application process and give HRM engineers a sense of how a project might impact the surrounding streets both from a safety and capacity perspective. Once submitted, statements are reviewed by HRM engineers to ensure they meet HRM policies, and that the findings in the report are supported by the evidence provided. Any needed changes to the TIS are outlined for the applicant, and this work continues until both sides are in agreement. In this case, no upgrades or changes to the surrounding streets were identified as being required at this time.10. How are construction activities monitored and regulated in the Municipality?Construction activities in the Municipality are administered through several bylaws, which regulate various aspects of the construction process:(i) Blasting By-law B-600: Outlines minimum standards permitted when blasting within the Municipality. All blasting activities require a Blasting Permit from HRM.(ii) Grade Alteration and Stormwater Management Associated With Land Development By-law G-200: Applies to the grade alteration and Stormwater Management of the land.(iii) Construction Management Administrative Order 2018-05-ADM: Outlines best management practices for development of sites in proximity to public streets.(iv) Noise By-Law N-200: States that construction noise activity is permitted between the hours of 7:00am – 8:00 pm on weekdays, 8:00am-7:00pm on Saturdays, and 9:00 am-7:00 pm on Sundays, Statutory Holidays, Civic Holidays and Remembrance Day.(v) Truck Routes By-Law T-400: Controls the routes trucks must use and how trucks access a given site. This by-law applies to trucks used for hauling construction material and commercially uses as well (i.e. moving vans, deliveries, etc.).",

This notice was posted to this site onThursday, March 7, 2024, in accordance with the requirements of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ This application has had a long history and was originally considered through a plan amendment process. On August 1, 2017, Regional Council directed staff to consider this application as a site-specific amendment to the now-replaced Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy. Specifically, Regional Council directed staff to continue to process this request for site-specific secondary municipal planning strategy amendments subject to the proposal: (a) generally aligning with theJune 2017 Centre Plandocument relative to Urban Structure, Height and Floor Area Ratio, and (b) addressing the planning principles of transition, pedestrian-orientation, human-scale, building design, and context-sensitive as noted the report. As part of the public engagement strategy for this application,Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committeeand municipal Planning Staff held a public meeting on Monday, June 11, 2018. (Public Meeting Notes) This application was reviewed by theHalifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committeeon August 20, 2018. (Staff Presentation to Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee). The Heritage Advisory Committee(HAC) reviewed this application onWednesday, June 5, 2019. Regional Council hosted a public hearing on July 15, 2019 at Halifax City Hall. Following the hearing, Regional Council passed a motion to adopt the proposed amendments to the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law. The amendments were reviewed by the Provincial Director of Planning and came into effect. The amendments allowed for the consideration of development through the development agreement process. Subsequent to this, the entire policy and land use regulatory context (Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law) affecting Peninsula Halifax were completely replaced with the coming into force of the Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy and the Regional Centre Land Use By-law. The Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy contains policies (IM-42, IM-43, and IM-44) to enable Halifax and West Community Council to consider a development agreement on the subject lands. The new policies IM-42, IM-43, and IM-44 were intended to allow Community Council to consider a development agreement for a proposal submitted in June 2021. However, after further review, staff determined that the enabling policy set was not sufficient in scope to consider all elements of the June 2021 proposal. Therefore, amendments to the enabling policies will first be required before a development agreement for the June 2021 proposal can be considered by Community Council. On September 12, 2023, astaff reportwas before Regional Council for its consideration. Following discussion of the report recommendations, Regional Council initiated a process to consider amending Policies IM-43, IM-44, and IM-46 of the Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy in support of the application. Before any Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy amendments can be approved, Regional Council must first hold a public hearing. Before a development agreement is approved, Halifax and West Community Council must also hold a public hearing. Regional Council and Halifax and West Community Council have the ability to combine both public hearings into one public hearing. As per Section 240A of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, Council is able to provisionally approve a development agreement at the same meeting that it approves amendments to a municipal planning strategy that would be required to enable the consideration of the development agreement. The development agreement provisionally approved is considered fully approved when the supporting amendments to the municipal planning strategy take effect. A copy of any staff report related to this application may be obtained by contacting the office of the Municipal Clerk at 902-490-4210.",

The original development agreement was entered into in 1995 with Annapolis Basin Group Inc. for a 921-unit residential development referred to as Bedford Village, covering approximately 221 acres of land abutting Paper Mill Lake, Hammonds Plains Road and Highway 102. A total of 100 lots were developed in the late 1990s off Moirs Mill Road, Ahmadi Crescent, Richardson Drive and Baha Court. The existing agreement from 1995 stipulates that no more than 100 lots may be developed until such time as the collector road is constructed, because the only route out of the subdivision was eastward to the Bedford Highway and there was a desire to allow for some initial development to take place while also securing an access to Hammonds Plains Road. However, today there is another access route out of the subdivision, which is via Nine Mile Drive and Larry Uteck Boulevard to Highway 102.",
                "proposal": "This proposal encompasses approximately 56 of the original 221 acres. The major aspects of the proposal are as follows: 77 standard single-unit dwellings;137 small-lot or ‘R-0’ type residential dwellings (more narrow than traditional lots, allows for houses to be located close to or on the side property line);Construction of an extension of Moir’s Mill Road which will link to an extension of Nine Mile Drive (collector street), thereby creating access to Larry Uteck Blvd and Highway 102;Extensions of two local streets (Ahmadi Crescent, Richardson Drive), and construction of three new local streets;One small commercial site at proposed intersection of Moirs Mill Rd and Nine Mile Dr.;Two new park areas, an expansion of an existing park (treed area) at the end of Ahmadi Crescent, and two open space areas;New walkways and trails which link the new streets with parks and open spaces;Increase of setback from watercourses, from 50 feet to 66 feet (20 metres);New detailed water quality monitoring program and testing requirements for Paper Mill Lake.",

The Aerotech Business Park was developed in the 1980s with a plan to create a “campus” supporting aerospace and technology. Planning policies and zones permit industrial uses that support technology- or airport-related facilities only. Since the original plan was made, market demand has changed and there have not been new aerospace-related occupants in some years. Business interest from non-technology and non-aerospace interests, such as warehousing, logistics and distribution, has been consistently active but are not allowed under current zoning rules. A key objective of both the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax's Economic Growth Plan is to ensure there is a sufficient supply of industrial lands to provide economic development opportunities. Aerotech Park is well suited for industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, logistical and transportation uses, given its direct links to 100-series highways and the central location of the international airport. The Park is separated from residential neighbourhoods and there are restrictions around further residential development in the area due to federal noise restriction guidelines surrounding the airport.Council is considering changes to municipal planning policies and zones that would expand the range of permitted industrial uses in Aerotech, and limit retail and commercial operations to accessory uses. No residential uses are being contemplated.

The zone would be placed on lands currently zoned Aerotech-Holding (A-H), which border the Waverley Game Sanctuary.

The Regional Plan supports a mix of low and medium-density housing, walkable streets, active transportation routes and quality transit connections in this growth centre through a secondary planning process. A community visioning exercise was completed in 2011 for the Middle Sackville Urban Local Growth Centre. The community identified desired features for the area including recreational opportunities, an outdoor public gathering space, a cultural centre, a commercial centre, a variety of housing types and seniors housing. At their meeting on December 4, 2018, Regional Council directed staff to undertake a comprehensive secondary planning exercise to amend the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, Regional Subdivision By-law, Secondary Municipal Planning Strategies and Land Use By-laws for Sackville and Beaver Bank, Hammonds Plains and Upper Sackville to enable a complete community in the Middle Sackville Urban Local Growth Centre comprised of residential, commercial, institutional and recreational development on lands surrounding the Highway 101 – Margeson Drive interchange.View the staff initiation report.",

This is a residentially zoned site within an established residential area; however the current commercial use is permitted by a development agreement. A development agreement is a legal agreement between the Municipality and a property owner which can allow uses that the zoning does not include, but in turn can also contain site specific requirements to ensure the property is developed in a certain way. Using planning policy which exists in theDartmouth Municipal Planning Strategy, Council previously entered an agreement for this property.

                "proposal": "The applicant is requesting a non-substantive amendment to the existing development agreement (DA) for the Links at Brunello to permit the construction of a nine-storey residential building with 76 dwelling units. The existing development agreement permits a mixed-use development consisting of a golf course, mixed residential uses, park and open space uses, and commercial areas. There have been several amendments to the existing agreement since its approval in 2001. Section 2.4.4 and 3.1(c) of the existing development agreement permits new multi-unit dwellings through a non-substantive amendment to the development agreement. The major aspects of the proposal are as follows: Nine-storey building with parking podium76 dwelling unitsAccessed via Amalfi WaySurface parking for 17 vehicles and internal parking for 80 vehiclesLandscaped yards with screening fence and vegetative buffer The applicant has submitted updated Development Plans (provided below). The updated plans include: Changes to the parking podium and addition of soft landscaping;Reconfiguration of turning circle and pedestrian walkways;Changes to surface parking areas to increase the amount of soft landscaping; andAddition of vegetative buffer and retaining walls. Frequently Asked Questions These FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) have been compiled by HRM staff to answer many of the common questions residents have about the proposal and non-substantive amending agreement process. 1. What is a development agreement?A development agreement is a contract between the landowner and the municipality which says how a piece of land can be used and may include details around land use, building design, the layout of streets and roads, and the density of various land uses. This contract is registered on title and, if the land is sold, all future owners will be responsible for the content of the agreement. Development agreements can be approved by Community Council as long as the proposal meets the rules held within local planning policy documents.2. Why can the developer ask to change an approved development agreement?Changes (or amendments as they are often called) to existing development agreements are fairly common and are often permitted within the development agreement itself. Two categories of changes to an agreement are possible: “Non-Substantive” changes are specifically called out in the original agreement and need to meet the intent of both the policies of the Municipal Planning Strategy as well as the content of the agreement itself. Non-substantive amendments are changes that were contemplated at the time the agreement was originally approved.This proposed amendment is a Non-Substantive Amendment.A Non-Substantive Amendment is a change to the agreement that does not require a formal Public Hearing. The Development Officer may approve non-substantive amendments to a development agreement. This is the case for most requests for non-substantive amendments.A ‘Substantive Amendment” are changes not contemplated by the original agreement, and therefore seen as more significant. These changes still need to meet the intent of the Municipal Planning Strategies and require a Public Hearing to be held before Council makes their decision on the changes.3. How can a multiple unit dwelling be permitted here?The existing development agreement allows multiple unit dwellings in four different areas of this community, as identified on a map previously approved by Council. The site where this building is proposed is within one of the areas that allows multiple unit dwellings. While the use is already allowed, this non-substantive amendment process will specify the look, location, height, density, and other details of the building.4. What’s the role of the planner in the planning application process?The central role of HRM’s planning staff in the planning application process is to compare an application against any Council approved policy and regulation that may apply and make a recommendation to the Development Officer (for non-substantive amendments) or Council for their final decision. As part of this process, HRM staff circulate applications to subject matter experts both within its organization (ie: Development Engineering, Traffic Services, etc.) as well as external to its organization (ie: Nova Scotia Power, Halifax Regional Centre for Education, etc.). Planning staff are available to answer questions and address concerns about the technical details of a project, as well as the planning process itself.5. The view I have from my home will be blocked by this new development. Is that allowed? What about shadows?As a general rule, planning policies do not protect or guarantee private views nor the shadowing of private spaces like backyards, balconies, or solar panels. Some policies do however exist around the protection of public views from key locations such as the Halifax Citadel and the Dartmouth Common. Similarly, there are some policies within newer planning documents that limit the amount of shadow a new building can cast on key public parks such as the Halifax Common.6. Will a vegetative buffer (trees, shrubs, or other landscaping) or privacy screening (fence) be provided?The existing development agreement requires that the parking area be screened by fencing, landscaping, or a combination of both, from the ground floor view of any abutting single unit dwellings. The existing development agreement requires that all areas of the lot not required for parking and access be landscaped, retained in natural vegetation, or a combination of the two. The proposal includes landscaping throughout the site and fencing along all lot boundaries abutting single unit dwellings.7. Can the existing water, wastewater and stormwater service systems capacity handle these additional units?The existing development agreement establishes an overall maximum density for the development agreement area. The proposed amendment will not change nor increase the overall permitted residential density maximums set out in the existing agreement. Water, wastewater & stormwater design specifications and servicing capacity will be confirmed at the permitting stage when detailed drawings and servicing plans are submitted for review.8. Will a crosswalk be provided on Timberlea Village Parkway?This application does not propose new crosswalks or other infrastructure located off the subject site. This would not prevent a reassessment of pedestrian connections and crossings in the area once development is completed.9. What is a traffic impact statement, who prepares them, and how does HRM review them?A traffic impact statement, or TIS, is written at the expense of the applicant by professional engineers. These statements are submitted at the start of the planning application process and give HRM engineers a sense of how a project might impact the surrounding streets both from a safety and capacity perspective. Once submitted, statements are reviewed by HRM engineers to ensure they meet HRM policies, and that the findings in the report are supported by the evidence provided. Any needed changes to the TIS are outlined for the applicant, and this work continues until both sides are in agreement. In this case, no upgrades or changes to the surrounding streets were identified as being required at this time.10. How are construction activities monitored and regulated in the Municipality?Construction activities in the Municipality are administered through several bylaws, which regulate various aspects of the construction process:(i) Blasting By-law B-600: Outlines minimum standards permitted when blasting within the Municipality. All blasting activities require a Blasting Permit from HRM.(ii) Grade Alteration and Stormwater Management Associated With Land Development By-law G-200: Applies to the grade alteration and Stormwater Management of the land.(iii) Construction Management Administrative Order 2018-05-ADM: Outlines best management practices for development of sites in proximity to public streets.(iv) Noise By-Law N-200: States that construction noise activity is permitted between the hours of 7:00am – 8:00 pm on weekdays, 8:00am-7:00pm on Saturdays, and 9:00 am-7:00 pm on Sundays, Statutory Holidays, Civic Holidays and Remembrance Day.(v) Truck Routes By-Law T-400: Controls the routes trucks must use and how trucks access a given site. This by-law applies to trucks used for hauling construction material and commercially uses as well (i.e. moving vans, deliveries, etc.).",

What is a traffic impact statement, who prepares them, and how does HRM review them?A traffic impact statement, or TIS, is written at the expense of the applicant by professional engineers. These statements are submitted at the start of the planning application process and give HRM engineers a sense of how a project might impact the surrounding streets both from a safety and capacity perspective. Once submitted, statements are reviewed by HRM engineers to ensure they meet HRM policies, and that the findings in the report are supported by the evidence provided. Any needed changes to the TIS are outlined for the applicant, and this work continues until both sides are in agreement. In this case, no upgrades or changes to the surrounding streets were identified as being required at this time.10. How are construction activities monitored and regulated in the Municipality?Construction activities in the Municipality are administered through several bylaws, which regulate various aspects of the construction process:(i) Blasting By-law B-600: Outlines minimum standards permitted when blasting within the Municipality. All blasting activities require a Blasting Permit from HRM.(ii) Grade Alteration and Stormwater Management Associated With Land Development By-law G-200: Applies to the grade alteration and Stormwater Management of the land.(iii) Construction Management Administrative Order 2018-05-ADM: Outlines best management practices for development of sites in proximity to public streets.(iv) Noise By-Law N-200: States that construction noise activity is permitted between the hours of 7:00am – 8:00 pm on weekdays, 8:00am-7:00pm on Saturdays, and 9:00 am-7:00 pm on Sundays, Statutory Holidays, Civic Holidays and Remembrance Day.(v) Truck Routes By-Law T-400: Controls the routes trucks must use and how trucks access a given site. This by-law applies to trucks used for hauling construction material and commercially uses as well (i.e. moving vans, deliveries, etc.)."

The planning documents have been reviewed and approved by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing as per the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter. This notice was posted to this site onThursday, March 7, 2024, in accordance with the requirements of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ This application has had a long history and was originally considered through a plan amendment process. On August 1, 2017, Regional Council directed staff to consider this application as a site-specific amendment to the now-replaced Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy. Specifically, Regional Council directed staff to continue to process this request for site-specific secondary municipal planning strategy amendments subject to the proposal: (a) generally aligning with theJune 2017 Centre Plandocument relative to Urban Structure, Height and Floor Area Ratio, and (b) addressing the planning principles of transition, pedestrian-orientation, human-scale, building design, and context-sensitive as noted the report. As part of the public engagement strategy for this application,Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committeeand municipal Planning Staff held a public meeting on Monday, June 11, 2018. (Public Meeting Notes) This application was reviewed by theHalifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committeeon August 20, 2018. (Staff Presentation to Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee). The Heritage Advisory Committee(HAC) reviewed this application onWednesday, June 5, 2019. Regional Council hosted a public hearing on July 15, 2019 at Halifax City Hall. Following the hearing, Regional Council passed a motion to adopt the proposed amendments to the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law. The amendments were reviewed by the Provincial Director of Planning and came into effect. The amendments allowed for the consideration of development through the development agreement process. Subsequent to this, the entire policy and land use regulatory context (Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law) affecting Peninsula Halifax were completely replaced with the coming into force of the Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy and the Regional Centre Land Use By-law. The Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy contains policies (IM-42, IM-43, and IM-44) to enable Halifax and West Community Council to consider a development agreement on the subject lands. The new policies IM-42, IM-43, and IM-44 were intended to allow Community Council to consider a development agreement for a proposal submitted in June 2021. However, after further review, staff determined that the enabling policy set was not sufficient in scope to consider all elements of the June 2021 proposal. Therefore, amendments to the enabling policies will first be required before a development agreement for the June 2021 proposal can be considered by Community Council. On September 12, 2023, astaff reportwas before Regional Council for its consideration. Following discussion of the report recommendations, Regional Council initiated a process to consider amending Policies IM-43, IM-44, and IM-46 of the Regional Centre Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy in support of the application. Before any Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy amendments can be approved, Regional Council must first hold a public hearing. Before a development agreement is approved, Halifax and West Community Council must also hold a public hearing. Regional Council and Halifax and West Community Council have the ability to combine both public hearings into one public hearing. As per Section 240A of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, Council is able to provisionally approve a development agreement at the same meeting that it approves amendments to a municipal planning strategy that would be required to enable the consideration of the development agreement. The development agreement provisionally approved is considered fully approved when the supporting amendments to the municipal planning strategy take effect. A copy of any staff report related to this application may be obtained by contacting the office of the Municipal Clerk at 902-490-4210.",

The original development agreement was entered into in 1995 with Annapolis Basin Group Inc. for a 921-unit residential development referred to as Bedford Village, covering approximately 221 acres of land abutting Paper Mill Lake, Hammonds Plains Road and Highway 102. A total of 100 lots were developed in the late 1990s off Moirs Mill Road, Ahmadi Crescent, Richardson Drive and Baha Court. The existing agreement from 1995 stipulates that no more than 100 lots may be developed until such time as the collector road is constructed, because the only route out of the subdivision was eastward to the Bedford Highway and there was a desire to allow for some initial development to take place while also securing an access to Hammonds Plains Road. However, today there is another access route out of the subdivision, which is via Nine Mile Drive and Larry Uteck Boulevard to Highway 102.",

Both documents outlined the need for more industrial land in HRM to accommodate demand.

The Aerotech Business Park was developed in the 1980s with a plan to create a “campus” supporting aerospace and technology. Planning policies and zones permit industrial uses that support technology- or airport-related facilities only. Since the original plan was made, market demand has changed and there have not been new aerospace-related occupants in some years. Business interest from non-technology and non-aerospace interests, such as warehousing, logistics and distribution, has been consistently active but are not allowed under current zoning rules. A key objective of both the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax's Economic Growth Plan is to ensure there is a sufficient supply of industrial lands to provide economic development opportunities. Aerotech Park is well suited for industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, logistical and transportation uses, given its direct links to 100-series highways and the central location of the international airport. The Park is separated from residential neighbourhoods and there are restrictions around further residential development in the area due to federal noise restriction guidelines surrounding the airport.Council is considering changes to municipal planning policies and zones that would expand the range of permitted industrial uses in Aerotech, and limit retail and commercial operations to accessory uses. No residential uses are being contemplated. Three new zones are being proposed to replace the existing zones: Airport General Industrial (AGI) zone, which will permit both light and heavy industrial uses, and limited commercial and retail that support industrial uses.Airport Commercial Industrial (ACI) zone, which will permit light industrial uses, and a range of supportive commercial, retail and office uses.Halifax International Airport (HIA) Zone, which will permit aircraft, aerospace and airport-related facilities and services, commercial uses that support airport operations, and manufacturing, construction and warehousing uses. The policies and full list of permitted uses proposed for each of these three zones is available here: Airport General IndustrialAirport Commercial IndustrialHalifax International Airport The areas bordering Aerotech Business Park contain wetlands and Provincial protected areas, as well as the Bennery Lake Watershed which supplies servicing to the Halifax International Airport and properties on Aerotech Drive. The Bennery Lake Watershed is designated under Provincial legislation and has Provincial regulations governing activities and land uses in the area. The current municipal designation and zone, applied before these regulations were created, do not reflect the Provincial permitted uses. Amendments are being proposed that would align Provincial and Municipal policies. Council is also considering the following changes to enhance watershed and wilderness protection: Changes to the boundaries of the Protected Area designation and Protected Water Supply zone around Bennery Lake, to reflect the protected area set byProvincial watershed regulations. The watercourse buffers have also been updated to reflect Provincial regulations (within 30 metres of any watercourse and 100 metres of Bennery Lake).Changes to the Regional Plan that would create a new Urban-Settlement-Employment (US-E) zone that would permit utilities, conservation uses, and public parks and playgrounds. The zone would be placed on lands currently zoned Aerotech-Holding (A-H), which border the Waverley Game Sanctuary. Under this zone, the lands would be earmarked for future industrial development, but only after studies establishing environmental, infrastructure, cultural and servicing needs upon development take place. The lands proposed for the temporary Urban Settlement-Employment (US-E) zone may be seen on the Draft Zoning Map below.
